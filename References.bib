ABSTRACT = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) poses distinct challenges, especially in settings with variable elements, which demand the integration of multiple sensors to ensure robustness. This study addresses these issues by integrating advanced technologies like LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), visual-inertial odometry (VIO), and sophisticated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) preintegration methods. These integrations enhance the robustness and reliability of the SLAM process for precise mapping of complex environments. Additionally, incorporating an object-detection network aids in identifying and excluding transient objects such as pedestrians and vehicles, essential for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of environmental mapping. The object-detection network features a lightweight design and swift performance, enabling real-time analysis without significant resource utilization. Our approach focuses on harmoniously blending these techniques to yield superior mapping outcomes in complex scenarios. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is substantiated through experimental evaluation, demonstrating their capability to produce more reliable and precise maps in environments with variable elements. The results indicate improvements in autonomous navigation and mapping, providing a practical solution for SLAM in challenging and dynamic settings.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, smart mobile devices include more and more sensors on board, such as motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), wireless signal strength indicators (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee), and visual sensors (LiDAR, camera). People have developed various indoor positioning techniques based on these sensors. In this paper, the probabilistic fusion of multiple sensors is investigated in a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework for mobile-device user-positioning. We propose a graph structure to store the model constructed by multiple sensors during the offline training phase, and a multimodal particle filter to seamlessly fuse the information during the online tracking phase. Based on our algorithm, we develop an indoor positioning system on the iOS platform. The experiments carried out in a typical indoor environment have shown promising results for our proposed algorithm and system design.},

abstract = {Last decade observed a significant research effort directed towards indoor localization utilizing location fingerprinting techniques. Fingerprinting solutions generally require a pre-deployment site survey procedure during which a radio-map is constructed by laboriously collecting signal strength samples (e.g., Wi-Fi) over the whole localization area. However, such localization efforts have certain shortcomings. For example, it is time consuming, labor intensive, vulnerable to environmental changes, and the process requires certain pedigree on the surveyor that may deem the fingerprinting techniques impractical to be deployed over large areas (e.g., shopping malls, multi-storey offices/residences, etc.). Newer emerging techniques try to bypass this expensive pre-deployment effort of fingerprinting solutions altogether. They may build the radio-map through the implicit participation of the building occupants, office employee, shoppers, visitors, etc. Apart from the traditional performance comparison criteria like accuracy, precision, robustness, scalability, algorithmic complexity based on which the localization techniques were evaluated, these newer approaches warrant some additional ones. For example, whether they require an actual geographical map of the localization area, the percentage of occasional location fix to ensure reasonable accuracy, the usage of explicit/implicit user participation to construct the radio map, the usage of building landmarks (e.g., entrance, conference room, elevator, escalator, etc.) or additional sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.), whether they address device heterogeneity, etc. In this article, we survey the newer emerging fingerprinting solutions that try to relieve the pre-deployment woes. We also identify some newer performance comparison criteria based on these solutions’ inherent characteristics, and apply them together with the traditional ones in order to evaluate a number of such proposed systems.}

ABSTRACT = {WiFi fingerprinting, one of the most popular methods employed in indoor positioning, currently faces two major problems: lack of robustness to short and long time signal changes and difficult reproducibility of new methods presented in the relevant literature. This paper presents a WiFi RSS (Received Signal Strength) database created to foster and ease research works that address the above-mentioned two problems. A trained professional took several consecutive fingerprints while standing at specific positions and facing specific directions. The consecutive fingerprints may enable the study of short-term signals variations. The data collection spanned over 15 months, and, for each month, one type of training datasets and five types of test datasets were collected. The measurements of a dataset type (training or test) were taken at the same positions and directions every month, in order to enable the analysis of long-term signal variations. The database is provided with supporting materials and software, which give more information about the collection environment and eases the database utilization, respectively. The WiFi measurements and the supporting materials are available at the Zenodo repository under the open-source MIT license.},

abstract = {Self-adaptation enables software to execute successfully in dynamic, unpredictable, and uncertain environments.  Control theory provides a broad set of mathematically grounded techniques for adapting the behavior of dynamic systems. While it has been applied to specific software control problems, it has proved difficult to define methodologies allowing non-experts to systematically apply control techniques to create adaptive software. These difficulties arise because computer systems are usually non-linear, with varying workloads and heterogeneous components, making it difficult to model software as a dynamic system; i.e., by means of differential or difference equations.  This paper proposes a broad scope methodology for automatically constructing both an approximate dynamic model of a software system and a suitable controller for managing its non-functional requirements. Despite its generality, this methodology provides formal guarantees concerning the system's dynamic behavior by keeping its model continuously updated to compensate for changes in the execution environment and effects of the initial approximation.  We apply the methodology to three case studies, demonstrating its generality by tackling different domains (and different non-functional requirements) with the same approach. Being broadly applicable and fully automated, this methodology may allow the adoption of control theoretical solutions (and their formal properties) for a wide range of software adaptation problems.},

ABSTRACT = {After decades of research, there is still no solution for indoor localization like the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) solution for outdoor environments. The major reasons for this phenomenon are the complex spatial topology and RF transmission environment. To deal with these problems, an indoor scene constrained method for localization is proposed in this paper, which is inspired by the visual cognition ability of the human brain and the progress in the computer vision field regarding high-level image understanding. Furthermore, a multi-sensor fusion method is implemented on a commercial smartphone including cameras, WiFi and inertial sensors. Compared to former research, the camera on a smartphone is used to “see” which scene the user is in. With this information, a particle filter algorithm constrained by scene information is adopted to determine the final location. For indoor scene recognition, we take advantage of deep learning that has been proven to be highly effective in the computer vision community. For particle filter, both WiFi and magnetic field signals are used to update the weights of particles. Similar to other fingerprinting localization methods, there are two stages in the proposed system, offline training and online localization. In the offline stage, an indoor scene model is trained by Caffe (one of the most popular open source frameworks for deep learning) and a fingerprint database is constructed by user trajectories in different scenes. To reduce the volume requirement of training data for deep learning, a fine-tuned method is adopted for model training. In the online stage, a camera in a smartphone is used to recognize the initial scene. Then a particle filter algorithm is used to fuse the sensor data and determine the final location. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, an Android client and a web server are implemented. The Android client is used to collect data and locate a user. The web server is developed for indoor scene model training and communication with an Android client. To evaluate the performance, comparison experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that a positioning accuracy of 1.32 m at 95% is achievable with the proposed solution. Both positioning accuracy and robustness are enhanced compared to approaches without scene constraint including commercial products such as IndoorAtlas.},

ABSTRACT = {The widely applied location-based services require a high standard for positioning technology. Currently, outdoor positioning has been a great success; however, indoor positioning technologies are in the early stages of development. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of indoor fingerprint positioning based on Wi-Fi. First, some indoor positioning technologies, especially the Wi-Fi fingerprint indoor positioning technology, are introduced and discussed. Second, some evaluation metrics and influence factors of indoor fingerprint positioning technologies based on Wi-Fi are introduced. Third, methods and algorithms of fingerprint indoor positioning technologies are analyzed, classified, and discussed. Fourth, some widely used assistive positioning technologies are described. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future possible research interests are discussed. It is hoped that this research will serve as a stepping stone for those interested in advancing indoor positioning.},
